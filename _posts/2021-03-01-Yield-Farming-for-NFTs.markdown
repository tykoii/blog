# New Revenue Streams

Open Koii provides NFTs with new income streams while expanding and optimizing NFT capabilities via “Koii Assets”.

## Moving Beyond ERC-721

The accessibility of the ERC-721 standard has led to an explosion of digital art, but as we’ve discussed in a previous blog, this is imperfect. Currently, a small number of marketplaces house the majority of these NFTs, mostly as ERC-721 contracts.

## Atomic NFTs

The launch of the Atomic NFT standard on the Arweave allows for digital creators to mint permanent assets that provide attention-based income streams in the form of $KOII rewards. Not only does this standard provide creators with new opportunities to earn a “yield” on their NFT, but it closes the loop on digital creation.

# Earn Rewards

By registering their NFTs on the Arweave with Koii, collectors and creators will be able to earn a secondary revenue stream in the form of attention rewards, and ensure long term preservation of their assets with implicit permanence.

## Reducing Waste

Creators can upload their creations directly to the permaweb as Koii assets, or transfer their ERC-721 NFTs to the Koii NFT portal. This means that ERC-721 NFTs can now earn passive dividends forever, just by being displayed in a Koii-compatible gallery. NFTs can also be minted directly to the permaweb via the Koii network, bypassing the need for the Ethereum blockchain and wasteful gas cost.
