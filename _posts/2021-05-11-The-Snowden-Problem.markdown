# There are serious problems with the current Web 2.0 paradigm..

Possibly one of the biggest problems to come to light was in 2013 when Eric Snowden copied and then leaked highly classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA). U.S. officials condemned his actions as having done "grave damage" to the U.S. intelligence capabilities, but how is this still an issue today almost 8 years later?

This event made it crystal clear that control over a population’s personal data is not a power which the government will soon cede.

Many Web2 users don't know about this issue and most who do aren't bothered by it. A common response to the mass collection of personal data is, “I have nothing to hide," though in reality it is not about what anyone has to hide but rather how a population’s collective data can be used. Hint, it isn’t always to protect you from terrorism.

Big tech companies like Google, Facebook and Instagram exploit users through their terms and conditions where we blindly agree to have our information mined. As you scroll through these platforms, like posts and make search queries you are constantly being data-mined and profiled. This is by design.

It is a tale as old as time. We think we are consumers, but in fact we are the product. Even when “creating” on these networks, value is being extracted from your presence on the site. Value which you will never see.

How can we combat this problem? _The answer: Koii_

Koii is a decentralized ecosystem that gives ownership back to creators, rewarding users for their attention rather than exploiting them. Developers build on Koii, and creators receive KOII based on attention.

To top it off, Koii is built on Arweave’s permaweb, meaning users never have to worry about their content being taken down or owned by other entities. Take back control with Koii.
