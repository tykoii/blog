# Installing the Koii browser extension is so quick and easy that this may be the shortest tutorial you’ve ever seen!

To get started just follow these steps and your new browsing companion Finnie will be ready to go! Very soon, Finnie will be available in the Chrome store.

To install the extension manually you need to download and unzip the file first. Then follow the steps to load the Finnie Wallet into your browser.

To download the extension, go to [koii.network/getFinnie](https://koii.network/getFinnie){:target="\_blank"}. This will automatically begin the download. Then unzip (or extract) the folder.

After you have downloaded the file, go to Chrome Settings using three dots on the top right corner of your browser, or skip the next two steps and just type "chrome://extensions/" into your browser.

Select “Extensions” from the menu on the left side of the window.
