### Who are you?

Former brewmaster, current IT professional living in Kingston ON, maker of digitally generated artworks. Started with voxel art actually, initially on magicavoxel, learning about colours and proportions. Recently became a father and recently got into NFTs - just a coincidence I swear!

<br>

## What makes you want to make stuff?

I’ve always had a drive to make stuff for as long as I can remember. When I was young I found I loved working with my hands. I love seeing people react and respond when they experience something I crafted whether it’s beer or artwork, you get immediate, tangible results when you share your work.

<br>

## What are you working on right now?

I’m working on a series of NFTs - initially it was voxel scenes but I moved away from that medium as I explored the project. I think it’s going to be a video synthesis and procedural generated project. It’s a really long process, iterating on the parameters for the art over and over again. We’ll see how much of that retro video synthesis I can work in… it’s one of those things where you don’t know what it will look like, but when you find the right path, it clicks. We’ll get there.

<br>

## What bothers you about the NFT space?

It’s pretty prohibitive to get into NFTs in general, because of gas fees and just interfacing with the apps. Plus you always are running the risk that if you don’t do enough research you may accidentally burn down a small rainforest in terms of energy costs if you mint on the wrong platform. The current platform fees too are kind of reminiscent of those really exclusive, traditional galleries that shut out artists of lower-to-middle incomes. The costs are steep, the gas fees are steep, it’s not for people like myself. I hate the idea of big wallet collectors trying to get artists to dance for them, impress them, etc. It’s not the kind of market I thought I could be a part of.

## What is your hope or vision for Koii?

Koii is an exciting project because it’s decentralized. Art should be community owned. People should control what they create, and if we are going to moderate, it should be community moderated. Also the whole initiative of reaching out to artists first is the better way to build things. There’s been a lot of projects where that’s what they say, but there’s no technical capability. Koii seems to have the right idea, building the attention rewards infrastructure, walking the walk before talking the talk. There are a ton of people who are like me, who have computers and want to mess around and try creating stuff, and those people deserve a space for themselves.

## Quick! Name three other artists you like and why.

1. [@p1xelfool](https://twitter.com/p1xelfool){:target="\_blank"} - I love their use of colours and motion. The artwork reminds me of something you'd see in a computer game from the late 90's early 2000s. Pixelated, colourful and exciting
2. [@gorillasu](https://twitter.com/gorillasu){:target="\_blank"} - One of the first people I interacted with in the generative art space. Super nice and makes some really interesting stuff. Easy to get lost in their works.
3. [@diskettepark](https://twitter.com/diskettepark){:target="\_blank"} - Combining glitch, pixel and generative art into some truly wild and interesting creations.
